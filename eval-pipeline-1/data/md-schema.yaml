# This is the schema for QuestionDoc v0.1 markdown<->json conversion.
#  - draft: 11.20.23
# 
# This schema outlines:
#   - which sections are major/minor
#   - how many "#" are used in the markdown for each respective section
#   - what are valid names for sections
# 
# Major sections: sheet, question
#   - since we use sheet=1, question=2, we can distinguish when parsing
#   - notice how major sections don't use the keyword `sheet` / `question`
#     but will instead extract the text in these respective headers as data.
# 
#  + `sheet` is optional, and if present, we assume only one at top of sheet
#    - if present with a `meta` section these properties in meta
#      will apply to each question on the doc.
#   
#  + `question` there can be multiple per sheet.
#     - each of these requires a `question` subsection
#     - and the other subsections are optional
#     - the properties in a question's meta section will override the 
#       properties 
# 
# Minor sections: 
#   - minor sections must use the keyword name in the header and all minor 
#     sections have the same md_header amount
# 
#   + `question` - required
#     - can use |EVAL-ENDCHAR| tag to strip trailing whitespace
# 
#   + `meta` - optional
#     - this is for listing key/value, 
#     - canonically listed in the markdowns as bullet points separated by colon
# 
#   + `templates` - optional (NotImplementedYet)
# 
#   + `answer`  - optional
#     - this is parsed well
#     - currently each question
#
